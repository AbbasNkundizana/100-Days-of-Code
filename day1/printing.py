#1. print function - Printing

print("Hello World!")

#print("She said: "Hello" and then left.")
print('She said: "Hello" and then left.')
print("She said: \"Hello\" and then left.")

#to print within quotation marks, interchage single quotes with double quotes or use the escape backward slash\ 
print("A 'single quote' inside a double quote")
print('A "double quote" inside a single quote')
print("Alternatively you can just \"escape\" the quote")

#printing multiple lines with one print statement use (\n)
print("Hello World!\nHello World!\nHello World")

#concatenating strings use plus (+) and space to leave a space between words
print("Hello Abbas,"+" ""How are you doing?")
print("Hello Abbas, " + "How are you doing?")
print("Hello Abbas," + " How are you doing?")

#2. Debugging - fixing code

# print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
#   print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
      
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the \"+\" sign.")
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

#3. input function - asking the user to enter information- input("A prompt for the user")
#use the print function and plus the commanding line of code to print the result. the plus does not work as a concatenator in this case
#input("What is your Name?: "))
print("Hello " + input("What is your Name?: "))
print(input("Where do you live?: "))
